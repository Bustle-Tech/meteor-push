# meteor-push-notifications
Push notifications for Meteor with latest APN for IOS and latest Firebase Admin for Android

This is an almost complete re-write of RAIX:PUSH. I wanted to do a PR but ... it was already a completely different piece of software.
Besides that, we run an up-to-date Cordova platform and at least phonegap-plugin-push@2.2.3 we know for sure that cannot run on the default Meteor because of the outdate cordova-android platform.

Documentation Updates WIP
This is a package in production runnnig with the following specs:
* Meteor 1.7.0.5
